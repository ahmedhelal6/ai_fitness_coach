# AI Fitness Coach 🏋️‍♂️

An end-to-end, real-time AI fitness coaching ecosystem. This project combines a high-performance **Flutter** mobile application with a **FastAPI** backend powered by **Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCN)**.

It doesn't just count reps; it understands human motion, provides real-time form correction, and generates comprehensive performance reports.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **Frontend (Mobile)**
*   **Framework**: [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) & [Dart](https://dart.dev)
*   **AI Engine**: [Google ML Kit Pose Detection](https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/pose-detection) (On-device landmark extraction)
*   **Networking**: [Dio](https://pub.dev/packages/dio) & WebSockets for real-time server communication.
*   **Data Visualization**: [FL Chart](https://pub.dev/packages/fl_chart) for workout analytics.

### **Backend (AI & API)**
*   **Framework**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) (Python)
*   **Deep Learning**: **ST-GCN** (PyTorch) for exercise classification.
*   **Form Analysis**: **LSTM** (PyTorch) for "Good vs Bad" form detection.
*   **Processing**: Physics-based Rule Engine for 100% accurate counting.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **🤖 Automated AI Classification**: Uses ST-GCN to automatically identify the exercise you are performing without manual selection.
- **⚙️ Physics-Based Counting**: Uses trigonometric rules and joint-angle analysis for **100% accurate** repetition tracking.
- **📢 Real-Time Form Correction**: Instant feedback banners guide you to maintain proper posture and technique.
- **📊 Dynamic Workout Reports**: Get a detailed breakdown of your performance, including total reps, accuracy, and form consistency.
- **⏱️ Hands-Free Experience**: Intelligent countdowns and motion-triggered starts allow you to focus entirely on your workout.
- **🔒 Privacy-First Design**: Video processing happens on-device; only numerical landmark data is sent to the server. No video is ever stored or transmitted.
